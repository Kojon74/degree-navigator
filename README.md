# Mock UBC Degree Navigator
Created this mock UBC Degree Navigator to run user tests to compare this system with our redisigned Course Planner page.
- [Mock UBC Degree Navigator](https://kojon74.github.io/degree-navigator/#/home/1)
- [Course Planner page](https://hogwartsdegreeplanner.netlify.app/)

Had users create a degree plan on the two platform to compare the results and see which one users perform better on and prefer.
